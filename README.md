LC8062 : SOCIAL INNOVATION PROJECT

## Introduction
This module equips students with a Design Thinking mindset in a social innovation context. They will collaborate in multidisciplinary groups to apply Design Thinking tools and methods to create innovative prototype solutions to real-life social issues faced by a user from a local community in need. It may be linked to active ageing, the environment, healthcare and social issues, among others. In the process, as the students study local trends and analyse multiple perspectives on issues, they will develop a better understanding of themselves and empathy for a local community in need. They will also realise the positive impact they can make in their immediate community. They will also be able to apply their teamwork skills in the course of their social innovation project, and communication skills in the presentation of the project.
